## CI-CD

### Development environment

You can initialize the development environment of `ipyvizzu` with `Python`
virtual env.

Run the `dev` make target to set up your environment.

```sh
make dev
```

**Note:** The `dev` make target is going to set up pre-commit and pre-push hooks
into your local git repository. Pre-commit hook is going to format the code with
`black` and pre-push hook is going to run the CI steps.

Run the `clean` make target to clear your environment.

```sh
make clean
```

### CI

The CI steps check code formatting, run code analyses, check typing and run unit
tests over the `ipyvizzu` project.

The `check` make target collects the above tasks. Run the `check` make target to
run the CI steps.

```sh
make check
```

#### Formatting

The `ipyvizzu` project is formatted with `black`.

Run the `format` make target to format your code.

```sh
make format
```

Run the `check-format` target to check code formatting.

```sh
make check-format
```

#### Code analyses

The `ipyvizzu` project is analysed with `pylint`.

Run the `check-lint` make target to run code analyses.

```sh
make check-lint
```

#### Typing

The `ipyvizzu` project is using type hints.

Run the `check-typing` make target to run check code typing.

```sh
make check-typing
```

#### Testing

The `ipyvizzu` project is tested with `unittest` testing framework.

Run the `test` make target to run the tests.

```sh
make test
```

### Documentation

Run the `doc` make target to build the documentation.

Note: If you modify the documentation, you also need to configure the
`JavaScript` development environment.

```sh
make dev-js

make check-js

make doc
```

Online version can be read at [ipyvizzu.com](https://ipyvizzu.vizzuhq.com).

The preset, static and animated chart examples are generated from the
[vizzu-lib](https://github.com/vizzuhq/vizzu-lib) repository. If you would like
to build them too, run the following commands.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vizzuhq/vizzu-lib.git

make doc
```

### Release

`ipyvizzu` is distributed on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ipyvizzu).
**Note:** You need to be an administrator to release the project.

If you want to release `ipyvizzu` follow the steps below.

- You should increase the version number in `setup.py`. The version bump should
  be in a separated commit.

- Create the release notes from the
  [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG/) and publish the
  new release on [Releases](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu/releases).

**Note:** Publishing a new release will automatically trigger the `release`
workflow which builds, checks and uploads the `ipyvizzu` package to
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ipyvizzu).

You can build and check the package before a release with the `release` make
target.

```sh
make release
```
